# 🚀 CrowdFunded

> Decentralized. Transparent. Powered by blockchain — fueling innovation through community-driven funding.

## 🎯 Objective

What problem does your project solve, and who does it serve?  

- Decentralized Funding: Easily contribute to innovative projects, knowing that every transaction is transparent and secure via blockchain.

- Secure & Transparent: Blockchain ensures all contributions and project details are immutable, creating a trustless environment where everyone can verify progress and spending.

- Global Access: Anyone, anywhere can participate without intermediaries, breaking down barriers to funding for creative and entrepreneurial minds.

- Lower Risk: Smart contracts automate the funding process, reducing human error and increasing accountability.

### Our Approach:  

- We chose to tackle the lack of transparency and trust in crowdfunding by making it decentralized and verifiable on-chain.
- We solved wallet connection issues, ensured secure transactions, and made contribution tracking fully transparent.
- A major breakthrough came when digging into OnChainKit’s source code, which helped us properly fetch user wallet addresses and streamline blockchain interactions.
